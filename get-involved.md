## How can you get involved? 


The Rikers Debate Project is always looking for volunteers! Although our in-person classes have been suspended since mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are running a correspondence course for  currently incarcerated students across the country and a debate program for formerly incarcerated people over Zoom. In addition, we are holding virtual events, continuing our Fellowship program for formerly incarcerated people, and engaging in advocacy work. Please indicate your interests in the form below, and someone from our team will reach out to you.
