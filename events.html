      <p><strong>Winter Party:</strong> We threw a successful winter fundraiser at 10 degrees bar on December 16th. We secured dozens of donations to buy supplies and make other investments into our new class at the Rose M Singer Center.</p>

      <p><strong>First Public Debate:</strong> Our first public debate featured Rikers Debate Project Teachers Rocky Lotito and Alex Taubes partnering with inmate champions Juel Roundtree and Terrell Wigfall. The debate topic was “Should Prisoner’s Have the Right to Vote”</p>

      <h3>Upcoming Events</h3>

      <p><strong>Samantha Bee Chairs our Second Public Debate:</strong> Following a successful public debate on Prisoner Enfranchisement in October, the Rikers Debate Project will be holding another public debate as an opportunity for our students to showcase the debate skills they’ve developed. After an internal tournament in the class, the top two debaters will be chosen to pair with two of our teachers and debate a new topic at the GRVC Visitors center.
