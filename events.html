      <h3>Upcoming Events</h3>

      <p><strong>Samantha Bee Chairs our Second Public Debate:</strong> Following a successful public debate on Prisoner Enfranchisement in October, the Rikers Debate Project will be holding another public debate as an opportunity for our students to showcase the debate skills they’ve developed. After an internal tournament in the class, the top two debaters will be chosen to pair with two of our teachers and debate a new topic at the GRVC Visitors center.
