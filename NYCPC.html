      <p><strong>Purpose</strong>: The New York City Program Council is a coalition of 
        correctional programming organizations. Co-founded by the Rikers Debate Project, the Council formed to advocate for currently
        incarcerated individuals and to ensure their programs remain at a high quality level and are being delivered efficiently. Over the years weâ€™ve shared 
        our work with elected officials and drafted legislation pertaining to the program environment in NYC Department of Corrections facilities. All members of the program
        council represent organizations who are working or have worked delivering programs in Department of Corrections facilities across New York City. </p>
      <p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>To structurally reform the <a href="https://doccs.ny.gov/">NYC Department of Correction</a> programming
          environment to make it a positive model for correctional programming nationally.</li>
        <li>To give program providers and justice-involved New Yorkers agency over programming at the Department of
          Correction.</li>
        <li>To streamline and rationalize communication between providers, uniformed, and nonuniformed correctional
          staff to ensure efficient management of correctional programming.</li>
        <li>To set, monitor, and make publicly transparent goals and metrics for correctional programming in New York
          City.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Projects:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><u>Security Training Reform</u>: The Council seeks to redesign the required provider training process</li>
    to improve content, streamline delivery into one session, reduce the burden of renewal
      applications, and integrate formerly incarcerated teachers into delivering part of the training.
       <li><u>Program Menu</u>: The Council aims to work with DOC to ensure that each person detained in</li>
      NYC receives a detailed guide to which programs are offered in their facility, when, and how
      they can sign up to attend. By creating a public record of available programs, this will improve
      management and transparency.</li>
        <li><u>Programming Metrics</u>: The Council will work with DOC on identifying and ensuring the</li>
      
        collection and dissemination of appropriate metrics of programming.</li>
        <li><u>Programming Model Legislation</u>: The Council aims to pass legislation enshrining its status and</li>
      authority over programming activities as well as specific measures to enact the projects above.</li>
